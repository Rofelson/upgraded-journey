# Polars
Two languages have made a big impression on the lasts stackoverflow's most loved survey: the rapidly rising Elixir and the dominating Rust. As the first one is developping as a python-like functionnal language for resilient and highly concurrent systems, the second is getting a lot of traction in type safe, fast and reliable systems.
When the functionnal pythonic Elixir got it's own NumPy (multi-dimensional arrays), it chose the shiny rust based framework for it's backend : Polars.
But don't worry, they have a [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/polars/) for Pandas users.

# Why
To follow the trend of rewriting [everything](https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/) in Rust but also to adress the shortcomings of Pandas, a project born in 2011 that didn't envision the scale of the data needs in 2023 by the words of it's own [author](https://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/). So just as Pandas, it offers tools to read and write data in various formats with it's fast parsers, including a highly performant [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) reader. Most of it's difference with Pandas are what makes its strength.

## Apache Arrow
Apache  is a columnar memory format designed for efficiency in analytics operations on our modern computation units (both CPUs and GPUs). It allow zero-copy data-access to manipulate large datasets at maximum speed.
